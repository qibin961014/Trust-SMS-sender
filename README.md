## <center>A More Convinient SMS Sending APP
This is the repository created by Qi Bin and Sun Hu to store the files we make or use for the App "Trust".


# Background and Motivation
One of the designers of this app is a member of the student union. One of the common work for a senior student union member is to send group SMS. However, the functions of the basic SMS sender provided by Android is too limited. For example, if some members of the SMS group want to change their phone numbers, the sender have to rebuild a new group, which means he or she have to input  changed phone numbers as well as a lot of unchanged numbers. In addition, if the sender want to store some groups which would be used in the future, there's also no function available.

Therefore, the designers wants to create an App for those group SMS senders to help them to build and manage the groups as well as send SMS.


# Target Users
This App is designed for those who needs to send group SMS very often, such as members of the student union, teaching assistants, officers, etc.

# Basic Functions
   1. Send group messages.
   2. Create, delete and revise groups.
   3. Add, delete and revise the names and the phone numbers in the chosen group.
   4. Add new names and phone numbers from the users phone dictionary.
   5. Manage the groups.


# Advanced Functions
These functions are based on the basic ones, which means only after basic functions are finished, will we consider add these advanced functions into our App. Also, these functions may not be achieved by App Inventor. So whether these functions will appear in our app still needs future consideration.

1. Create, edit, upload use and delete message templates.
2. Send SMS at certain time automatically.
3. Add different "names" into the messages to different phone numbers. (e.g. A group contains 2 people, Mike and Nick, whose phone numbers are 110 and 120. The sender want to send blessing SMS to them, such as "Happy new year!". This function allows the sender to send different SMS to Mike and Nick using the same template. The message Mike receives is "Mike, happy new year1" and Nick receives "Nick, happy new year!")

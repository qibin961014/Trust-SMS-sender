# Trust-SMS-sender-
This is the repository created by Qi Bin and Sun Hu to store the files we make or use for the App "Trust".


# Background and Motivation
One of the designers of this app is a member of the student union. One of the common work for a senior student union member is to send group SMS. However, the functions of the basic SMS sender provided by Android is too limited. For example, if some members of the SMS group want to change their phone numbers, the sender have to rebuild a new group, which means he or she have to input  changed phone numbers as well as a lot of unchanged numbers. In addition, if the sender want to store some groups which would be used in the future, there's also no function available.

The designers wants to create an App for those group SMS senders to help them to build and manage the groups as well as send SMS.
